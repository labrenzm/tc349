		<p>What's a SketchNote? A SketchNote is a totally different and unique way of taking notes in class or just about anywhere.
		Instead of just taking normal, bland notes, flex your creative muscles! This is a picture of my first sketchnote from my personal finance class.  
		As you can see, you don't have to be an artist to do these!
